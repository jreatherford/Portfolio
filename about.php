            <p>Hello!  My name is James Reatherford and I am a programmer.
            
            <p>I am 23 years old and at the moment I am a student at the University of North Alabama.  
                I am engaged to a wonderful lady who understands my obsessive need to write code.
            
            <p>I have been writing code since 9th grade.  I picked up Visual Basic 6 as a hobby
                and, well, it just took off from there.  I could not stop.  Soon I started learning C++.
                Then college came, and I really started learning.  It has been a fun experience.  Now I am
                ready to put what I have learned to the test.
                
            <p>My hobbies include: Video Games, Project Euler, Chess Tactics, MTG, and Cooking.
                
            <p>I hope you like this little portfolio I have made and I hope you will consider
                me for a position with your company.  I won't let you down.
