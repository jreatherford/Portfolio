	Hello potential future employeer!  If you are visiting this site, I assume you enjoyed my resume and wanted to know more.
	If you are viewing this code, I take it you want to get an idea of how I code.  Feel free to look around, but I warn you:
	
	I am new to web programming.  Really new.  This and an hour of codeAcadamy are all the experience I have had with Javascript.
	I know some HTML, but this is my first time touching it in probably at least 5 years.  (I really focused on things like C++ and java)
	This was also my first look at CSS.  (I had to change a font size in the clean.css file because my name was too long to fit on screen right)

        So please don't judge my code too hard.  I am taking a class right now to improve my web development skills.  I want to learn more.  I want to be awesome with javaScript, PHP, and ect.,
	
	I'd like to learn with you.  I still need some more training, but I promise I will be worth it.
	
	I hope you enjoyed my little site.  I know I've enjoyed making it.

	Cheers!
	-James

		<h2>Current Projects:</h2><br>

                <p>
		<b>Software Engineering Project</b><br>
                For my software engineering project, I am working with a team to create a web based application that handles the scheduling of classes<br>
                for an entire department at UNA.  It will also be able to take into account things such as teacher preferences.<br>

                <b>Astronomy Project</b>
                <p>
                For my Astronomy class, a friend and I are creating software in Java that presents information about objects in our solar
                system in an interactive way (such as letting students calculate how much they would weigh on mars)</br>
                </p>

                <b>Compiler Construction</b>
                <p>For my Automata class, I am going to build the scanner and parser for a small language (it is a subset of pascal)</p>

		<p><h2>Why Hire Me?:</h2></p>
		
		<p>
		Hi. My name is James.<br>
		I'm 23 years old and about to graduate college.<br>
		I am also a programmer who wants a job.<br>
		You want to hire a programmer.<br>
		Let me convince you I am both the programmer you need, and the programmer you deserve.</p>
		
		
		<b>Love at First Compile</b>
		<p>
		It started when I was in 9th or 10th grade (can't remember which).<br>
		I was that nerdy kid. You know the type. I did extra algebra homework for fun.<br>
		I watched Star Wars more than I should be willing to admit.<br>
		The point is it was only a matter of time before someone asked me if I knew anything about programming.<br>
		A friend suggested I give it a shot and I did. I picked up some books on Visual Basic 6 and went to town.<br>
		After several months of learning and writing programs (a few of which were on download.com for a while) I decided to take up C++.<br>
		That is when I decided two things:<br>
		1) C++ is much harder to learn than VB6<br>
		2)This is what I want to do for the rest of my life</p>
		
		<b>College</b>
		<p>
		So I made good grades.<br>
		I got a scholarship.<br>
		I went to UNA to study computer science.<br>
		This has been the best choice of my life.<br>
		I've learned code.<br>
		I've solved problems.<br>
		More importanly, I've learned how to learn code.<br>
		I've learned how to solve problems.<br>
		And now, I am ready to learn how to solve your problems.</p>
		
		<b>The future..</b>
		<p>
		I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.<br>
		But I can't do that without some help.<br>
		Let's code together.<br>
		Let me be your programmer and we shall rule the galaxy as coder and employeer...</p>
